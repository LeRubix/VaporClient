# Vapor Client

**Vapor Client** is a modern game client application for downloading, torrenting, and managing your game library. Inspired by Steam, Vapor Client provides a familiar, user-friendly interface to organize, launch, and keep track of your games, whether they are downloaded directly, torrented, or added manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need IGDB API credentials. The program starts with an onboarding where you'll enter these credentials. Instructions will be displayed for more information. <br>
> & Optionally, you will need a torrent client if you intend on using the torrenting. I recommend [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download)

## Features

- **Game Store**: Browse a curated store of games, click on any game you want, download it for free, and add the games to your personal library!
- **Game Details**: View detailed information for each game, including description, categories, release date, developer, publisher, and system requirements.
- **Library**: Manage your games, add your own custom games, and track your playtime, and launch games from within the client.
- **Wishlist**: Add games to your wishlist for easy access and a list of games you plan to play.
- **Profile Management**: Customize your profile with a display name, avatar, bio, and location. View your last played games and activity. Your profile can be locally exported, then sent to your friends!
- **Community**: Import your friend's profile files and view their profiles, and game activity!
- **Data Persistence**: All user data, including library, profile, and settings, are saved locally for privacy and offline access. They can be cleared at any time through the red button on your profile.

## How It Works

1. **Store & Library**: Browse the store, search for games, and add them to your library or wishlist.
2. **Download & Play**: Download games directly or via torrent. Launch installed games from your library.
3. **Profile**: Edit your profile, view your last played games, and export/import profile data.
4. **Game Management**: Use the Python GUI or CLI tools to add or edit games in the database.

## How To Use

1. Install the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/LeRubix/VaporClient/releases/latest)
2. Run the Installer.exe
3. The program will automatically open once installed
4. The program can then be found on your desktop, the start menu, or C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\VaporClient
5. Enter your IGDB credentials on the onboarding screen
6. Click on any game in the store or add your own game in the library

## Future Plans:
1. Online friend system instead of importing
2. Discord presence/status support
3. Game Reviews
4. Category Filtering <br>
& more! You can leave feedback or suggestions by clicking the report button in the settings tab :)

I hope you enjoy Vapor Client!
